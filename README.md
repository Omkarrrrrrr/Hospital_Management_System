# Hospital Management System

## Introduction

The Hospital Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage the daily operations of a hospital. This system allows users to manage patient and doctor information, schedule appointments, and check doctor availability. The project uses JDBC for database connectivity and interacts with a MySQL database to store and retrieve data.

2. Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
3. Install Git for version control.
4. Clone the project repository from GitHub.

## Creating a Database Schema

1. Install MySQL or your preferred database system.
2. Create a new database for the Hospital Management System.
3. Define and create tables for patients, doctors, and appointments.
4. Establish relationships and constraints between the tables.

## Java JDBC Connectivity

1. Add the MySQL JDBC driver to your project.
2. Configure the database connection parameters (URL, username, password).
3. Establish a connection to the database using JDBC.

## Managing Patients and Doctors

1. Implement functionality to add new patients to the system.
2. Implement functionality to view all patients in the system.
3. Implement functionality to add new doctors to the system.
4. Implement functionality to view all doctors in the system.

1. Implement functionality to schedule new appointments.
2. Implement functionality to view all scheduled appointments.

## Checking Doctor Availability

1. Implement functionality to check the availability of doctors for specific dates.

## Running the Application

1. Compile and run the application using your IDE.
2. Ensure your MySQL database server is running and accessible.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to add patients, add doctors, schedule appointments, and check doctor availability.
